    "content": "This method is suited for computer running under the Linux Ubuntu OS.\nGoal For various reasons, we want to easily switch between two (or more!) version of the R language with RStudio.\nFrom my side, I have a specific setup of R packages installed within a Singularity environment. But, I fail to access the version of R within this environment, using RStudio. So, I installed everything locally and ask RStudio to open the specific version of R.\nMethod The method consists in:\nlocate the path to R versions of interest define alias to open RStudio using each of these versions define desktop shortcuts to open RStudio in one click Locate or install the R versions of interest First, locate the folders where are installed the R versions of interest. For me, I have:\nVersion Folder 3.6.3 /usr/local/src/R-3.6.3 4.2.2 /usr/local/src/R-4.2.2 Exemple to install R version 3.6.3:\nDownload the archive associated with the version of interest there: https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/ (eg. R-3.6.3.tar.gz) version=\"3.6.3\" wget -O R-${version}.tar.gz https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-${version:0:1}/R-${version}.tar.gz Decompress the archive in the final folder. # Move the archive in the final folder sudo mv R-${version}.tar.gz /usr/local/src/ # Decompress the archive cd /usr/local/src/ sudo tar -zxvf R-${version}.tar.gz # Remove the archive sudo rm -f R-${version}.tar.gz # Change directory to the uncompress archive cd R-${version} Install R. sudo ./configure sudo make sudo make install Check the installed version. R --version The default R version used by RStudio is accessible by the which R command. It can be /usr/bin/R, which is a shortcut for the last version installed. If you installed first R 4.2.2 and then R 3.6.3, /usr/bin/R --version will show the 3.6.3 version.\nNote: Within RStudio, another R version can be forced by setting the RSTUDIO_WHICH_R variable in the ~/.Renviron (or ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc) file. For instance:\nRSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/usr/local/src/R-4.2.2/bin/R Define aliases In the ~/.bashrc file, create as many aliases as you have R versions of interest.\nalias r363=\"export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/usr/local/src/R-3.6.3/bin/R' rstudio\" alias r422=\"export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/usr/local/src/R-4.2.2/bin/R' rstudio\" Note: The above commands work for Ubuntu 24.04. However, to Ubuntu 20.04, a ; should be added:\nalias r363=\"export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/usr/local/src/R-3.6.3/bin/R' ; rstudio\" alias r422=\"export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/usr/local/src/R-4.2.2/bin/R' ; rstudio\" To consider the changes, source the ~/.bashrc file:\nsource ~/.bashrc You should now be able to open RStudio with R 3.6.3 (or R 4.2.2) by running the r363 (or r422) alias command in the terminal.\nNote: Using the ~/.profile file to define an alias was not working on my computer, running under Ubuntu 20.04.\nDefine shortcuts To avoid opening the terminal and typing 4 characters to open RStudio, we can define shortcuts ! The shortcut will be represented as a logo, pinned to the dashboard. For this, many tutorials exist. I followed the one from Rich Hewlett.\nCreate a .desktop file, for instance called rstudio_with_r363.desktop, containing:\n[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Terminal=false Name=RStudio R3.6.3 Icon=/path/to/a/beautiful/rstudio_pink.png Exec=bash -c 'exec bash -i \u003c\u003c\u003c \"r363\" ' Categories=Application; Details:\nTerminal=false to not open the terminal in background Name is the hover text when you pass the cursor above the icon Icon corresponds to the path to the icon Exec is a command behind the shortcut. I found it on Stackoverflow Do not forget the ; in the end You may have as many .desktop files as you have R versions of interest.\nTo add the shortcuts in the dashboard from Ubuntu, save the .desktop files in the ~/.local/share/applications folder.\nThen, pin the shortcut to the dashboard:\nfind the shortcut using its Name, in the Ubuntu Menu right click to ‘Pin to Dash’ No need to restart the computer: everything should be well recognized !\nResources:\nRich Hewlett’s blog Stackoverflow",

    "content": "Context We have a local folder MAIN associated with a GitHub repository, also called MAIN. The structure is as follows:\nMAIN ├── 1_dir_A │ ├── content_AA │ │ ├── file_AAA.ext │ │ └── file_AAB.ext │ └── content_AB │ ├── file_ABA.ext │ ├── file_ABB.ext │ └── file_ABC.ext ├── 2_dir_B │ ├── content_BA │ │ ├── file_BAA.ext │ │ └── file_BAB.ext │ └── content_BB │ ├── file_BBA.ext │ └── file_BBB.ext ├── README.md ├── .git └── .gitignore Goal We want to:\nkeep the structure of MAIN make a new folder TOTO associated with the content of 2_dir_B keep the history of 2_dir_B in the new repository (default) keep the history of 2_dir_B in the main repository define 2_dir_B as a submodule of MAIN Method Make sure that the MAIN repository is up-to-date with your local folder, using git pull and/or git push commands. Duplicate the MAIN repository Clone the MAIN repository to initate the new one: git clone https://github.com/user-name/MAIN.git TOTO Move to TOTO: cd TOTO Get all branches (optional) Get all the branches and tags from the MAIN repository, because they have not been imported using git clone: git branch -a # check the current branches git fetch origin git branch -a # check the current branches (optional) If there are SOME branches to copy, run: git checkout -b SOME origin/SOME git branch -a # check the current branches Detach from origin Detach the local repository TOTO from the MAIN repository. git remote -v # check the remote host: MAIN.git git remote rm origin git remote -v # no more host Subset the new repository Filter the directory to keep only the 2_dir_B folder. We should --force because there is no origin. git filter-repo --path 2_dir_B/ --force Move the 2_dir_B folder content to the root: git mv 2_dir_B/* . git mv 2_dir_B/.gitignore .gitignore # for the hidden files rm -Rf 2_dir_B Add the untracked files from MAIN to TOTO. This step can/should/must be done manually by using the graphical file explorer…\nCheck that TOTO contains everything present in MAIN/2_dir_B:\ndiff -r /path/to/TOTO /path/to/MAIN/2_dir_B Ensure to ignore the folders and files that should not be tracked by the git system: nano .gitignore # fill in manually Define the commit, but do not push since there is no remote yet. git status # everything should be added git add * # if necessary, for instance .gitignore git commit -m \"Filter only 2_dir_B content\" Define the new repository On GitHub, create a new empty (no README, no LICENSE) repository, for instance called TITI.\nDefine the new origin for the TOTO folder:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/TITI.git git remote -v # check the remote host Push the changes. We use --force if no file has been changed but only the git history has been filtered. We use --all to include all the branches. git push --force --all origin git push --tags origin # optionally, if there are tags Define a submodule in MAIN Go to the MAIN directory: cd /path/to/MAIN Remove the 2_dir_B folder, both from tracking and locally: git rm -r 2_dir_B rm -Rf 2_dir_B/ (optional) To eventually remove this folder from the history, use git filter-branch. git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch 2_dir_B' HEAD git push origin main --force Note: I don’t know how to modify this to apply it on all branches. Actually, one should use git filter-repo --path 2_dir_B/ --invert-paths to remove a folder from history. But, it removes also the remote so I have no idea how to make it works.\nDefine 2_dir_B as a submodule of MAIN. It creates a .gitmodules file. git submodule add https://github.com/username/TITI.git 2_dir_B git commit -m \"Define submodule 2_dir_B\" git push origin main # push the .gitmodules file That’s all ! :smile:\nOutput The MAIN directory has not changed:\nMAIN ├── 1_dir_A │ ├── content_AA │ │ ├── file_AAA.ext │ │ └── file_AAB.ext │ └── content_AB │ ├── file_ABA.ext │ ├── file_ABB.ext │ └── file_ABC.ext ├── 2_dir_B │ ├── content_BA │ │ ├── file_BAA.ext │ │ └── file_BAB.ext │ └── content_BB │ ├── file_BBA.ext │ └── file_BBB.ext ├── README.md ├── .git └── .gitignore However, on the MAIN GitHub repository, 2_dir_B points to the last commit synchronized. For instance 2_dir_B @3c8464b.\nThe TOTO folder contains:\nTOTO ├── content_BA │ ├── file_BAA.ext │ └── file_BAB.ext ├── content_BB │ ├── file_BBA.ext │ └── file_BBB.ext ├── .git └── .gitignore On the TITI GitHub repository, there is no trace of the MAIN, but the history of all the tracked files is conserved from their creation in the MAIN repository.\nResources Useful resources:\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/moving-git-repository-new-server/ https://graphite.dev/guides/git-filter-repo",
